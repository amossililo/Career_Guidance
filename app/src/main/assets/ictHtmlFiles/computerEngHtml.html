    <h1> Computer Engineering</h1>


    <!--your automatic html file goes here -->
    <p>Computer engineering involves the design and development of
        systems based on computers and complex digital logic devices.
        It integrates electronics engineering and computer science to
        design and develop computer systems and other technological
        devices. Computer engineers evaluate, design, and maintain
        computer hardware and software system.
        It is a program that prepares individuals to apply scientific
        principles to the design, development and operational evaluation of computer hardware and
        software systems and related
        equipment and facilities; and the analysis of specific problems
        of computer applications to various tasks.
        The following are variations in Computer Engineering:</p>
