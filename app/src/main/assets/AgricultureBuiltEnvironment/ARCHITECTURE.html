    <h1> ARCHITECTURE
    </h1>
    <p>
        Architecture is the discipline that is concerned with the planning, designing and the
        overseeing of the construction of the built environment (man-made environment and
        structures). It is the art and technique of designing and building as distinguished from the
        skills associated with construction. Architectures work in the construction, planning, and
        design phases of projects. In conjunction with other team members, the focus is on building
        structure and interior design. This includes heating, ventilation, air condition,
        electrical, fire protection, lighting, plumbing and other systems specific to the project.
