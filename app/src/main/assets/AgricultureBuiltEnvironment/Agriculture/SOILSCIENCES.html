    <h1> Soil SCIENCE </h1>
    <p>Soil Chemistry and Physics<br/>A program that focuses on the application of chemical and
        physical principles to research and analysis concerning the nature and properties of soils
        and the conservation and management of soils. It includes instruction in soil and fluid
        mechanics, mineralogy, sedimentology, thermodynamics, geomorphology, environmental systems,
        analytical methods, and organic and inorganic chemistry.</p>
    <p>Soil Microbiology<br/>
        A program that focuses on application of microbiological theory and
        methods to the study of the organismic properties of soils, soil-plant and soil-animal
        interactions, and the biological components and effects of soil management strategies. It
        includes instruction in microbiology and related biological sciences, applicable animal and
        plant sciences, soil chemistry and physics as related to biological characteristics, and
        environmental science.</p>
    <p>Soil Science and Agronomy, General<br/>A program that generally focuses on the scientific
        classification of soils, soil properties, and their relationship to agricultural crops. It
        includes instruction in soil chemistry, soil physics, soil biology, soil fertility,
        morphogenesis, mineralogy, hydrology, agronomy, and soil conservation and management.</p>
