    <h1> Plant SCIENCE </h1>
    <p>Agricultural and Horticultural Plant Breeding</p>
    <p>A program that focuses on the application of genetics and genetic engineering to the improvement of agricultural plant health, the development of new plant varieties, and the selective improvement of agricultural plant populations. It includes instruction in genetics, genetic engineering, population genetics, agronomy, plant protection, and biotechnology.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>Agronomy and Crop Science</p>
    <p>A program that focuses on the chemical, physical, and biological relationships of crops and the soils nurturing them. It includes instruction in the growth and behavior of agricultural crops, the development of new plant varieties, and the scientific management of soils and nutrients for maximum plant nutrition, health, and productivity.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>Horticultural Science</p>
    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific principles related to the cultivation of garden and ornamental plants, including fruits, vegetables, flowers, and landscape and nursery crops. It includes instruction in specific types of plants, such as citrus; breeding horticultural varieties; physiology of horticultural species; and the scientific management of horticultural plant development and production through the life cycle.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>Plant Protection and Integrated Pest Management</p>
    <p>A program that focuses on the application of scientific principles to the control of animal, insect and weed infestation of domesticated plant populations and other settings, including agricultural crops; the prevention/reduction of attendant economic loss; and the control of environmental pollution and degradation related to pest infestation and pest control measures. It includes instruction in entomology, applicable animal sciences, plant pathology and physiology, weed science, crop science, and environmental toxicology.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>Plant Sciences, General</p>
    <p>A general program that focuses on the scientific principles that underlie the breeding, cultivation, and production of agricultural plants, and the production, processing, and distribution of agricultural plant products. It includes instruction in the plant sciences, crop cultivation and production, and agricultural and food products processing.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>Range Science and Management</p>
    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of rangelands, arid regions, grasslands, and other areas of low productivity, as well as the principles of managing such resources for maximum benefit and environmental balance. It includes instruction in livestock management, wildlife biology, plant sciences, ecology, soil science, and hydrology.</p>
