    <h1> AGRICULTURE EXTENSION </h1>
    <p>Agriculture extension is the discipline that deals with the application of scientific
        research and new knowledge to agricultural practices through farmer education. It is the
        transfer of agricultural information and technology to farmers and similarly transferring
        information from farmers to researchers. Agricultural extension officers are the
        intermediaries between research and farmers, they operate as facilitators and communicators,
        helping farmers in their decision-making and ensuring that appropriate knowledge is
        implemented to obtain the best results with regards to sustainable production and general
        rural development.</p>
