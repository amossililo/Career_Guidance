        Regional and urban planning is a discipline that ensures that the development of the built
        environment is economic, promotes social development, is aesthetically appealing and that it
        meets the needs of the community. The discipline equips graduates to ensure that the land is
        used efficiently and that buildings are located in areas where services and facilities can
        be provided.
