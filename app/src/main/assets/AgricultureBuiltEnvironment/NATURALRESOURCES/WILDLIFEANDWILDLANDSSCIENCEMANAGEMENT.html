    <h1> WILDLIFE AND WILD LANDS SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT</h1>
    <p>A program that prepares individuals to conserve and manage wilderness areas and the flora,
        marine and aquatic life therein, and manage wildlife reservations and zoological/aquarium
        facilities for recreational, commercial, and ecological purposes. It includes instruction in
        wildlife biology, marine/aquatic biology, environmental science, freshwater and saltwater
        ecosystems, natural resources management and policy, outdoor recreation and parks
        management, the design and operation of natural and artificial wildlife habitats, applicable
        law and regulations, and related administrative and communications skills.</p>
    <p><strong>FORESTRY</strong><br/>A degree in forestry opens doors to job opportunities in science, industry and
        environmental management. In the past, forestry graduates may have considered park ranger
        jobs as their top career option; however, a new awareness of the need for conservation, new
        advances in science and the emergence of new problems with invasive species and destructive
        pests have changed and expanded the job landscape for foresters.<br/>Conservation and
        Resource Forester<br/>A degree in forestry can often lead to a career in conservation and
        resource management. Forester&rsquo;s survey and assess the health and status of public and
        privately owned woodlands, and develop conservation and management strategies. They protect
        wildlife habitats and address problems such as soil erosion, invasive species and pests that
        undermine tree health. They also determine how much timber can be harvested without
        endangering the sustainability of the forest ecosystem.<br/> <strong>Forest Ranger</strong> <br/>Jobs as
        rangers and park interpreters on state and federal forest lands are a traditional career
        path for graduates with degrees in forestry. Rangers patrol parks, enforce rules and assist
        visitors who need help and information. Rangers also monitor problems such as flooding or
        insect infestation, and report conditions to supervisors. While college degrees are not
        always required, pay is determined by education and experience and candidates with a degree
        in forestry earn higher salaries.<br/> <strong>Forestry Science Technician</strong> <br/>Forestry degree
        programs offer a variety of opportunities for students to pursue careers in tree genetics
        and biotechnology. Through research and selective breeding programs, foresters are finding
        ways to develop trees with more resistance to devastating pests. They have also been able to
        develop faster growing trees that yield timber with traits targeted to specific industries
        and uses.<br/> <strong>Procurement Agent</strong> <br/>Some foresters work as procurement specialists for
        paper, lumber and energy companies. Forester&rsquo;s survey and estimate the value of timber
        designated for harvest on public and private land. They help draw up contracts and may also
        hire teams of cutters and loggers to harvest trees. In some cases, they may oversee the
        construction of temporary roads as well as the restoration of the environment once the trees
        are cut</p>
    <p> <strong>Urban Forester</strong> <br/>Arborists work with individual trees while foresters work with large
        tracks of woods. Urban foresters who oversee the maintenance of public parks, street trees
        and inner-city reservations often need the skills of both professions. Urban foresters are
        responsible for new planting, tree removal and monitoring problems and diseases with pests.
        They are responsible for creating aesthetically pleasing wooded retreats for an urban
        population.<br/>Forests provide steady, reliable careers for thousands of Zambian workers.
        While forests seem to need little management, the reality is that forestry professionals
        spend their whole careers managing forests, harvesting wood, and replanting trees. The
        majority of jobs in the forestry industry fall into one of four categories: foresters and
        conservation scientists, forest and conservation technicians, forest and conservation
        workers and loggers. While three of these forestry careers share similar titles, the work
        varies, along with the job qualifications and forestry jobs salary.<br/> <strong>Foresters and
            Conservation Scientists</strong> <br/>Foresters manage forests. Their goal is to ensure that forests
        are healthy. Foresters manage the replenishment of forests that have been burned or reduced
        by logging. They also manage forests that have been harmed by plant disease, and they thin
        overgrown areas.<br/>To work as a forester, you need at least a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in
        forestry or a related field. Some forestry careers require a master&rsquo;s degree. Some
        states require licensing for foresters. Licensing standards include educational requirements
        and work experience in forestry. Most foresters work for the federal government, logging
        companies or saw mills.<br/><strong>Forest and Conservation Workers</strong><br/>Forest and conservation
        workers are the worker bees for foresters. They work predominantly for federal, state and
        local governments and logging companies. They plant seedlings to replenish forests that have
        been cut or burned, and they clear brush and debris from high-traffic recreation areas such
        as campgrounds and hiking trails. They also cut trees, spray insecticides and fungicides and
        work to prevent and suppress forest fires.<br/>These workers need a high school diploma. The
        better-paying jobs require work experience under the guidance of senior forest and
        conservation workers</p>
    <p><strong>Zoologists and Wildlife Biologists</strong><br/>Zoologists and wildlife biologists are naturalists who
        specialize in the study of animals. They observe and study wildlife, record their
        observations, write reports on their findings and make recommendations to the public and
        government officials on wildlife conservation and management. A bachelor&rsquo;s degree is
        the minimum requirement to enter the profession<br/><strong>Park Naturalists</strong><br/>Park naturalists,
        also called park rangers, park interpreters, program managers and environmental education
        specialists, help visitors to understand the historic and natural features of local, state
        or national parks. They prepare and present lectures, create brochures and newspaper
        articles, conduct field trips, answer visitor questions, and assist with the operation of
        visitor centers and other park facilities. The position generally requires a background in
        forestry, biology, wildlife management or natural resources conservation.<br/><strong>Industrial
            ecologists</strong><br/>Industrial ecologists create more efficient industrial processes that use
        natural resources effectively and preserve the environment. They analyze changes to natural
        ecosystems to understand their economic impact, develop alternatives for methods that may
        damage the environment, evaluate the effectiveness of industrial ecology programs, and
        examine how industrial, social and natural systems relate. A bachelor&rsquo;s degree in
        environmental science, natural science, biology or chemistry is the minimum prerequisite</p>
    <p><strong>Forest and Conservation Technicians</strong><br/>Forest and conservations technicians are naturalists
        who measure the quality of forests, rangeland and other natural areas. They patrol forest
        areas to enforce environmental regulations, run tests on water and soil quality, track
        wildlife, help build roads and trails, meet with other naturalists and the public about
        conservation activities, and train and lead seasonal workers who plant seedlings. The
        position typically demands at least an associate&rsquo;s degree in forestry or a related
        field, which is available at community colleges and technical institutes.<br/>Some foresters
        analyze the soil and health of trees, and determine ways to conserve them and minimize the
        impact of fi<br/><strong>Eco-Tourism</strong><br/>Eco-tourism careers offer a different approach to
        conventional travel. Eco-friendly travel integrates respect for indigenous people, minimal
        human impact, environmental conservation and financial benefits for local communities. As
        "greener" solutions continue to replace practices that adversely affect the environment,
        more eco-friendly travel destinations are available. This widens the market for job seekers
        who want environmentally responsible careers in the travel and tourism industry. Eco-tourism
        jobs attract all personality types and skill levels, from adventurous outdoorsy workers to
        administrative and housekeeping professionals.<br/><strong>Adventure</strong><br/>There is no limit to
        adventurous job opportunities in the eco-tourism industry. Conservation tours, or eco-treks,
        hire instructors for adventurous pursuits such as hiking, diving and bird-watching. Tour
        guides lead excursions and educate tourists about a specific region's climate and wildlife
        to raise awareness about threatened species and promote conservation efforts.<br/>Divers,
        for example, lead tours around endangered coral reefs. Professional photographers with an
        ecological bent capture images of native and sometimes endangered plants and animals.
        Photographers work with researchers and conservationists as they compile information for
        travellers to promote eco-tours.<br/><strong>Accommodations</strong><br/>Eco-lodges are accommodations that
        are built using green materials and technology. They are as unobtrusive as possible in
        natural settings. Architects, planners and engineers carve job niches in the eco-tourism
        industry by designing such custom-made buildings at travel destinations. Carpenters,
        electricians and plumbers with green-technology skills build and finish the buildings.<br/>Furniture
        makers, textile companies and food services supply eco-resorts with furnishings, linens and
        food that comply with their guidelines. Resorts employ massage therapists and nutritionists
        who cater to health-minded travellers. The resorts also need service employees, including
        housekeepers and wait staff.<br/><strong>Administration</strong><br/>Eco-tourism jobs include office and
        administrative positions for workers who want to use their organizational and people skills
        in environmentally conscious careers. Tour planners and schedulers find and organize
        excursions at travel destinations. Promoters advertise and market conservation tours.
        Eco-travel agents book trips for travellers. Website designers work with eco-travel agencies
        to build an online presence that promotes resort opportunities and the benefits of
        eco-tourism.</p>
