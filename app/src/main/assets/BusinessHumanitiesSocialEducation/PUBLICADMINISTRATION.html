        Public Administration is a branch of political science dealing primarily
        with the structure and workings of agencies charged with the
        administrations of government functions. According to Woodrow Wilson “it is
        the subject of administrative study to discover first, what government can
        properly and successfully do and secondly, how it can do these proper
        things with the possible efficiency and at the least possible cost either
        of money or energy”. It attempts to decipher how decisions in government
        are made as well as administrating government projects to carry out those
        decisions.
