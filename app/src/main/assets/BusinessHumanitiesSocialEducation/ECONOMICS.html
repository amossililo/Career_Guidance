    deter you from further study if you’re aiming at highly specialized roles
    (such as becoming a professional economist), but it’s useful to know that
    economics careers in finance and other sectors are widely available to
    those with just a bachelor’s degree. See below for more common careers in
    economics.

    As a professional economist, you’ll be involved in researching and
    analyzing economic data, issues and trends. For the majority of economist
    careers, you’ll need to study economics at postgraduate level to gain the
    specialist skills required. To be a professional economist you’ll also need
    to be confident in producing economic forecasts and reports to present to
    clients (individuals, companies, financial organizations and public bodies)
    and to advise on policy and/or business strategy accordingly.
</p>
<p>
    Possible employers include local and national government, public and
    private banks, insurance companies, think-tanks, large multinational
    companies, financial consultancies, accountancy firms and local
    authorities. A sound awareness of current affairs and economic contexts is
    essential in these roles.

    Banking careers are very popular with economics graduates, offering scope

    background in economics are particularly valued for roles in financial
    control, financial planning, risk analysis, data analysis and consultancy.
    With a focus on keeping the financial requirements of clients and
    businesses on track, banking careers are largely concerned with advising
    and providing services for a range of banking clients and consumers.

    To become a qualified accountant you’ll need further professional
    qualifications, but many accountancy roles are available to those who
    studied economics. In accounting roles you can work across multiple
    industries, focusing on monitoring the financial situation of an
    organization, business or individual. Careers in accountancy typically
    focus on recording, classifying, interpreting and communicating financial
    data.
</p>
<p>
    These careers require strong analytical skills, mathematical proficiency,
    computer literacy, an understanding of all elements of company finances,
    and the ability to contextualize the data collected. Economics graduates
    are often able to make sense of complex data sets and identify the root of
    financial problems, making them good matches for accountancy roles.

    Economists and economics experts are at the heart of the business world and
    financial consulting. Economics graduates may find positions in large and
    medium-sized organizations where economic research is required. The role of
    an economic researcher requires in-depth knowledge of economic theories and
    models, thorough analytical and problem-solving skills and mathematical
    ability. Financial consultants in the area of economics would fill similar
    roles but may work for multiple clients instead of just one organization,
    producing reports and advising on business strategy. Up-to-date industry
    knowledge and awareness of corporate finance is essential in these roles.

    Those who study economics will be valued in all areas of public and private
    spending, including roles within pricing and risk analysis, financial
    consultancy and economic planning. Economist careers in the public sector
    are often involved in public taxation, transport, commercial and waste
    services, energy and other forms of government spending. Thanks in large
    part to the most recent global recession, and the tightening of economic
    regulation by governments across the globe, economics students are
    currently seeing an increase in demand in this sector.

    An actuary is a business professional whose role is to evaluate and advise
    on the impacts of financial risk and uncertainty. Using knowledge of both
    business and economics, actuaries provide reports and devise strategies on
    how to lessen these risks. Most entry-level job roles in this field are
    within pensions and insurance, but later on you may have the opportunity to
    move towards areas including banking, investment and healthcare. Actuaries
    should be skilled in mathematics and compiling statistics, but also able to
    communicate complex data effectively to non-experts.
