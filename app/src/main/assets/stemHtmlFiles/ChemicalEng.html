        Chemical engineering is a multidisciplinary branch of engineering that combines natural and experimental sciences
        such as chemistry and physics along with life sciences such as
        biology, microbiology and biochemistry plus mathematics and
        economics and technology to design, manufacture, transform,
        transport, operate and manage industrial processes that turn raw materials into valuable products such as cosmetics, foods,
        pharmaceuticals, beverages, and cleaners with due recognition
        of economic viability, management of resources, health and
        safety, sustainability and environmental effects.

        <li> Education and research</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Chemical engineering is only offered at the CopperBelt University in Zambia in the school of mines and mineral sciences.
        Like, all engineering programs except for computer engineering
        chemical engineering degree is a 5-year program
