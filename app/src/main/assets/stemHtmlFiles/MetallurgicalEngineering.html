    <h2> Metallurgical Engineering
    </h2>
    <p>
        Metallurgical Engineering is the branch of engineering that
        deals with mineral processing technologies and the adaptation
        of metals for various engineering applications. It is the study
        of metals and how metals can be safely transformed into
        products that benefit humanity-things such as surgical implants,
        computer chips, cars, materials for space exploration and more.
        It is a program that prepares individuals to apply mathematical and metallurgical principles
        to the design, development
        and operational evaluation of metal components of structural,
        load-bearing, power, transmission, and moving systems; and the analysis of engineering
        problems, such as stress, creep,
        failure, alloy behaviour, environmental fluctuations, stability,
        electromagnetic and thermodynamic characteristics, optimal
        manufacturing processes, and related design considerations.
        Metallurgical Engineers study and produce materials that
        power our bodies and our world.

    <ul>


        <li>Develop and design processing techniques and machinery
            and have to consider the environmental impact of mineral
            processing.
        </li>
        <li>Conduct testing to ensure safety of materials.</li>
        <li>Develop sustainable materials and processes for recycling
            existing materials.
        </li>
        <li> Investigate material failures and create testing procedures
            to ensure materials can withstand extreme environments.
        </li>
        <li> Converts raw materials into an usable form.</li>
        <li>Design methods of separating metals from the rest of the
            components.
        </li>
        <li>Design and direct testing procedures.</li>
        <li>Monitor how materials perform and deteriorate.</li>
        <li>Determine the cause of product failure and develop ways
            to overcome the failure
