<h1> Mining Engineering</h1>
    <p>
        Mining engineering is a branch of engineering that involves the extraction,
        processing, and management of mineral resources from the earth. Mining
        engineers use their knowledge of geology, geophysics, and mineralogy to
        design, develop, and manage mining operations. They work to ensure that
        mining is done in a safe, efficient, and environmentally sustainable
        manner.
    </p>
