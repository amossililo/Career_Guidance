        Mining Engineering is a multidisciplinary branch of engineering that deals with the
        development and preparation of
        a mine in order to safely and efficiently extract resources
        while protecting the environment. It involves the location of
        valuable and accessible material deposits and devises processes
        for extracting them safely from the earth for the manufacturing
        industry and utilities. Mining Engineers strive to extract the
        minerals for the least cost and the lowest environmental impact. It is a program that
        prepares individuals to apply mathematical principles to the design, development and
        operational
        evaluation of mineral extraction, processing and refining
        systems, including open pit and shaft mines, prospecting
        and site analysis equipment and instruments, environmental
        and safety systems, mine equipment and facilities, mineral
        processing and refining methods and systems, and logistics
        and communications systems.
        Mining Engineering encompasses a wide range of engineering disciplines such as civil
        engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, metallurgy, geology, finance,
        law
        and economics. Mining engineering is sometimes referred to
        as a junk of all trade but master of none. Some duties of a
        mining engineer include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Designing mines, both underground and open-pits (surface
            mines
        </li>
        <li>Supervising constructions of mines, tunnels and shafts
            Machinery production and design
        </li>
        <li>Designing transportation plans to move minerals to processing plants</li>
        <li>Writing technical reports for miners, fellow engineers and
            mine managers</li>
        <li>Solving problems related to pollution, sustainability and
            land reclamation</li>
        <li> Monitoring safety mining operations, especially ensuring
            proper ventilation to all working surfaces</li>
        <li>Ensuring the safety of mining equipment and assessing
            mine equipment supplies</li>
        <li> Establishing extraction systems</li>
        <li>Reclaiming mine sites</li>


    </ul>

    <p><strong> Studying mining engineering may find one working as a:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Blasting engineer </li>
        <li>Investment’s analyst </li>
        <li>  Explosive’s engineer</li>
        <li>Short term Mine planning engineer </li>
        <li> Long term mine planning engineer </li>
        <li> Rock mechanics engineer</li>
        <li> Geotechnical engineer</li>
        <li> Optimization engineer</li>
        <li> Mine manager</li>
        <li> Open pit manager</li>
        <li> Underground manager</li>
        <li>Mine superintendent </li>
        <li> Government mining engineer</li>
        <li> Mine safety director</li>
        <li>Ventilation engineer</li>
        <li>Rock tools engineer</li>
        <li> Technical sales engineer</li>
