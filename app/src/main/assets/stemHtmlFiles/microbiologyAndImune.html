    <h1> Microbiological Sciences and Immunology</h1>

    <h3>The focus here in any field of study are science and immunology.</h3>

    <p><strong>i. Epidemiology</strong></p>
    <!--your automatic html file goes here -->
    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of disease,
        disability, and trauma patterns within and across populations
        and the development of health management mechanisms to
        prevent and control disease outbreaks and injurious behaviours.
        It includes instruction in biostatistics, biochemistry, molecular
        biology, immunology, disease and injury determinants, genetic
        disease and disability factors, behavioural studies, health services research, environmental
        disease and injury factors, and
        population studies.</p>

    <p><strong>ii. Biochemistry</strong></p>
    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of the chemistry of living systems, their
        fundamental chemical substances
        and reactions, and their chemical pathways and information
        transfer systems, with particular reference to carbohydrates,
        proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. It includes instruction in
        bio-organic chemistry, protein chemistry, bioanalytical chemistry, bioseparations,
        regulatory biochemistry, enzymology,
        hormonal chemistry, calorimetry, and research methods and
        equipment operation.</p>

    <p><strong>iii. Immunology</strong></p>


    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of the biological mechanisms involved in the
        pathogenesis of the disease,
        host-pathogen interactions, and host response to disease. It
        includes instruction in antigen and antibody structure and
        function, effector mechanisms, receptors, histocompatibility,
        host-pathogen recognition, disease modelling, autoimmune
        systems, antibody formation, cytotoxic responses, regulation
        of immune response, virulence determinants, intercellular signalling, immunosuppression,
        immunotherapy, immunogenetics, disease markers, transplantation, antibody humanization,
        and microbial pathogenesis.</p>

    <p><strong>iv. Parasitology</strong></p>


    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of biological
        organisms living in ecologically exploitative and competitive
        relationships with host organisms, and the role of parasites in
        causing injury, disease, and environmental damage. Includes
        instruction in vector biology, immune-parasitology, medical
        parasitology, molecular biology of parasitical associations,
        veterinary and comparative parasitology, chemotherapeutics,
        and ecological and systematic parasitology.</p>


    <p><strong>v. Virology
    </strong></p>

    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of subcellular
        pieces of genetic material, called viruses, that inhabit living
        cells in parasitical relationships and their role in disease. It
        includes instruction in virus taxonomy and systematics, viral
        structures, viral genetics, prions, virus/host cell interaction,
        viral pathogenesis, and applications to specific topics such as
        cancer biology.</p>

    <p><strong>
        vi. Toxicology
    </strong>
    </p>

    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of poisons
        and other biohazards; their interactions with organisms and
        their food and respiratory systems; and their prevention,
        management, and counteraction. It includes instruction in
        toxicological biochemistry, toxic agents and transporters, toxin
        fate, toxicokinetic and metabolism, toxin classification, molecular toxic mechanisms,
        extracellular matrices and cell function,
        bacterial pathogenesis and mutagenesis, pathophysiology and
        apoptosis, cell stress and injury, studies of specific toxins, and
        studies of specific organ systems and physiological functions
        in relation to toxicological problems.</p>

    <p><strong>vii. Entomology
    </strong></p>

    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of insect species
        and populations in respect of their life cycles, morphology,
        genetics, physiology, ecology, taxonomy, population dynamics,
        and environmental and economic impacts. Includes instruction
        in applicable biological and physical sciences as well as insect
        toxicology and the biochemical control of insect populations</p>
