    <p>
        This study deals with issues of fire control.

    </p>

    <p><strong>i. Fire Prevention and Safety Technology/ Technician</strong></p>

    <p >A program focusing on the application of fire science and
        technology to problems of reducing fire risk, limiting loss,
        supervising substance removal, conducting safety inspections
        and investigations, and advising on matters of safety procedures
        and fire prevention policy. It includes instruction in fire
        behaviour, fire simulation, structural risk assessment, materials
        analysis, detection and suppression systems, smoke management, supply and evacuation, public education, legal aspects
        of fire prevention, and related research and communications
        methods.</p>
    <p><strong>ii. Fire Science/Fire-fighting</strong></p>
    <p>A program focusing on the theory and practice of fires and
        fire-fighting. It includes instruction in fire chemistry and
        physics, combustible materials, computer science, building
        construction, fire codes and related laws, fire hydraulics,
        fire command, fire prevention/inspection, fire protection
        systems, fire suppression systems, fire/arson investigation,
        occupational safety, equipment operation, emergency medicine
        and communications.

    </p>

    <p><strong>iii. Fire Systems Technology</strong></p>
    <p>A program focusing on the theory and principles of fire
        combustion and behaviour applied to the analysis of fires and
        their causes. It includes instruction in fire behaviour and
        combustion, fire dynamics, hazardous materials chemistry,
        incendiary fire analysis, fire-related human behaviour, forensic
        procedures, investigative techniques, case management and
        case preparation.
