    <h1> Pure And Applied Physics</h1>

    <h3>The following are further specializations:</h3>

    <p><strong>i. Physics</strong></p>
    <!--your automatic html file goes here -->
    <p>A general program that focuses on the scientific study of
        matter and energy, and the formulation and testing of the laws
        governing the behaviour of the matter-energy continuum. It
        includes instruction in classical and modern physics, electricity
        and magnetism, thermodynamics, mechanics, wave properties,nuclear processes, relativity and
        quantum theory, quantitative
        methods, and laboratory methods.</p>

    <p><strong>ii. Nuclear Physics</strong></p>
    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of the properties
        and behaviour of atomic nuclei. It includes instruction in nuclear reaction theory, quantum
        mechanics, energy conservation,
        nuclear fission and fusion, strong and weak forces, nuclear
        modelling, nuclear decay, nucleon scattering, pairing, photon
        and electron reactions, the physics of nuclear effects, statistical
        methods, and research equipment operation and maintenance..</p>

    <p><strong>iii. Astrophysics</strong></p>


    <p>A program that focuses on the theoretical and observational
        study of the structure, properties, and behaviour of stars, star
        systems and clusters, stellar life cycles, and related phenomena.
        It includes instruction in cosmology, plasma kinetics, stellar
        physics, convolution and non-equilibrium radiation transfer
        theory, non-Euclidean geometries, mathematical modelling,
        galactic structure theory, and relativistic astronomy.</p>

    <p><strong>iv. Optics/Optical Sciences</strong></p>


    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of light energy,
        including its structure, properties and behaviour under different conditions. Includes
        instruction in wave theory, wave
        mechanics, electromagnetic theory, physical optics, geometric
        optics, quantum theory of light, photon detecting, laser theory,
        wall and beam properties, chaotic light, non-linear optics,harmonic generation, optical
        systems theory, and applications
        to engineering problems.
        With a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics or engineering
        physics, students can pursue careers in research and development, science engineering,
        education, medicine, law, and
        military. Current students can take advantage of the many
        research and internship opportunities available to help prepare
        them for the career of their choice. It’s important that you
        understand the career options available to you as a physics
        major. Common job titles for physics bachelor’s degree holders
        include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Accelerator operator</li>
        <li>Applications Engineer</li>
        <li>Data analyst</li>
        <li>Design Engineer</li>
        <li>High school physics teacher</li>
        <li>Information Technology consultant</li>
        <li>Lab Technician</li>
        <li> Laser Engineer</li>
        <li>Optical Engineer</li>
        <li>Research Associate</li>
        <li>Software developer</li>
        <li>System Analyst</li>
        <li>Web developer</li>
