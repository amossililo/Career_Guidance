    <h1>ElectroMechanical engineering</h1>
    <p>
        A program that prepares individuals to apply mathematical
        principles to the problems associated with combining mechanical components with special
        emphasis on manufacturing
        and automated processes. It includes instruction in applied
        mechanics, instrumentation and monitoring, machine design,
        automated control techniques, fluid and thermal dynamics,
        circuit analysis, and solid-state electronics.
        It is an engineering discipline that is a combination of
        mechanical and electrical systems. It specifically deals with the
        analysis, design, and maintenance of equipment and products
        based on the combination of electrical/electronic and mechanical systems. Products include:

    <p>Electromechanical engineers conceptualize and use machines
        that have both technologies mechanical and electrical. In Zambia, Electromechanical engineering is only currently offered
        at the Copperbelt University and it is a 5-year program degree
        level.
