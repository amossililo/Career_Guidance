<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.45pt;margin-bottom:14.35pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:9.0pt;line-height:111%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;color:#181717;'>The following are the further specialized programs in civil engineering:</p>
<p><strong>i.</strong><span style="white-space:pre;"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>Structural Engineering</strong></p>
<p>The program prepares to apply mathematical principles to the design, development and operational evaluation of materials and systems used in building load-bearing structures for various purposes and in different civil engineering environments, including buildings, roads, rail lines, bridges, dams, conduits, offshore platforms and workstations, and other structural shells; and the analysis of structural problems such as failure, fabrication, safety, and natural hazards.</p>
<p><strong>ii.</strong><span style="white-space:pre;"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>Transportation and Highway Engineering</strong></p>
<p>The program prepares individuals to apply mathematical principles to the design, development and operational evaluation of total systems for the physical movement of people, materials and information, including general network design and planning, facilities planning, site evaluation, transportation management systems, needs projections and analysis, and analysis of costs.</p>
<p><strong>iii.</strong><span style="white-space:pre;"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>Water Resources Engineering</strong></p>
<p>The program prepares individuals to apply mathematical principles to the design, development and operational evaluation of systems for collecting, storing, moving, conserving and controlling surface- and groundwater, including water quality control, water cycle management, management of human and industrial water requirements, water delivery, and flood control.</p>
<p>Civil engineers are the minds behind the way our modern towns and cities work; they are highly specialized experts, master planning, budgeting and analysts of projects. Every time you leave your home, you will see results of civil engineering from roads to railways and from skyscrapers to townhouses.</p>
<p>Studying civil engineering may find one working as;</p>

<p>Civil engineers can work in the following fields:</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The construction industry includes roads, skyscrapers and townhouses</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>City and municipal councils</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The aerospace industry, designing jetliners and space stations</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Shipbuilding industry</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sewerage systems and water systems</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Railway industry</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Power industry</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nation government departments such as RDA and NFRA</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Education and research</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Consultancy</p>
<p>Like all engineering programs, except for computer engineering, a civil engineering degree is a 5-year program.</p>
