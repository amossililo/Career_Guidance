        A program that prepares individuals to apply mathematical
        principles to the design, development, and maintenance of
        telecommunications technology, networks, and systems. It includes instruction in
        telecommunications, computer networking, communications networks and systems, signals,
        circuits,
        fibre optics, and wireless systems and technology.
        Telecommunications engineering is an engineering discipline
        centred on electrical and computer engineering responsible for
        designing and overseeing the installation of telecommunication
        equipment and facilities such as complex switching systems,
        telephone service facilities, optical fibre cabling, Ip networks
        and microwave, transmission systems and broadcasting. It
        specifically deals with the installation, testing and repair of
        communication systems, which include fixed lines and telephone networks, copper wire and
        fibre-optical cabling and
        digital satellite systems.
        Telecommunications engineers handle:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Providing high-speed data transmission</li>
        <li>Wireless modes of communication and information transfer, such as telephone services,
            radio and satellites communications
        </li>

    </ul>
    <p><strong>Where can a telecommunication engineer work?
    </strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li> Telecommunications industry</li>
        <li> National government departments</li>
        <li>Media industry</li>
        <li> Energy industry</li>
        <li> Mining industry</li>
        <li>Banking and financial services</li>
        <li> Industrial automations and flow of information and signals
            in the Mines, Manufacturing industries
        </li>
        <li> Education and research</li>


    </ul>
    <p>Like, all engineering programs except for computer engineering
        telecommunications engineering is a 5-year program</p>
