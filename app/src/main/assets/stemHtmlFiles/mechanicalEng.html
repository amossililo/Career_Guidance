        Mechanical engineering is a branch of engineering that
        combines engineering, physics and mathematics principles with
        material science to design, analyze, manufacture and maintain
        mechanical systems. It deals with the development, design,
        installation, operations and maintenance of mechanical systems
        that range from all mobile and immovable machinery that
        has ever been manufactured, they use tools such as computeraided design (CAD),
        computer-aided
        manufacturing (CAM) and
        product life cycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial
        equipment
        and machinery, heating
        and cooling systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft,
        robotics, medical devices and weapons.
        It is a program that prepares individuals to apply mathematical principles to the design,
        development and operational
        evaluation of physical systems used in manufacturing and endproduct systems used for
        specific
        uses, including machine tools,
        jigs and other manufacturing equipment; stationary power
        units and appliances; engines; self-propelled vehicles; housings
        and containers; hydraulic and electric systems for controlling
        movement; and integrating computers and remote control into

        <strong>i. Industrial Engineering</strong><br/>
        A program that prepares individuals to apply scientific
        principles to the design, improvement, and installation of
        integrated systems of people, material, information, and energy. It includes instruction in
        applied mathematics, physical
        sciences, the social sciences, engineering analysis, systems
        design, computer applications, and forecasting and evaluation
        methods.<br/>
        <strong> ii. Manufacturing Engineering</strong><br/>

        A program that prepares individuals to apply scientific
        principles to the design, development, and implementation of
        manufacturing systems. It includes instruction in materials
        science and engineering, manufacturing processes, process
        engineering, assembly and product engineering, manufacturing
        systems design, and manufacturing competitiveness.<br/>
        <strong> iii. Materials Engineering</strong><br/>

        A program that prepares individuals to apply mathematical
        and materials science principles to the design, development
        and operational evaluation of materials and related processes
        used in manufacturing in a wide variety of settings; the
        synthesis of new industrial materials, including marrying
        and bonding composites; analysis of material requirements
        and specifications; and related problems of system design
        dependent on materials factors.
        Mechanical engineering is the broadest engineering discipline and you are lucky if you are
        to find 2 girls in a mechanical
        engineering class.
        Students who want to study mechanical engineering must
        have a strong grounded skill in mathematics, physics and
        technical drawing. Studying mechanical engineering may find
        one working as:

    </ul>
    <p>Just like all engineering programs except for computer engineering mechanical engineering
        degree, is a 5 yearâ€™s program.</p>
    <p><strong>iv. Aeronautical Engineering</strong></p>
    <p>
        Aeronautical Engineering deals with the development of
        aircraft and spacecraft that includes military aircraft design and
        development, along with commercial airline design and satellite
        technology. It specifically deals with the design, analysis of
        aircraft structures, aircraft performances and their operations
        to transport goods, people and services around the globe.
        It is a program that prepares individuals to apply mathematical principles to the design, development and operational
        evaluation of aircraft, missiles, space vehicles, and their systems;
        applied research on flight and orbital characteristics; and the
        development of systems and procedures for the launching,
        guidance, and control of air and space vehicles.
