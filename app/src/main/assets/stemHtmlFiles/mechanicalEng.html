    <h1>Mechanical Engineering</h1>

    <p>
        Mechanical engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the
        design, development, analysis, and manufacturing of mechanical systems.
        Mechanical engineers use their knowledge of mechanics, thermodynamics,
        materials science, and other related fields to design and create a wide
        range of products, including machines, engines, vehicles, appliances, and
        more.
