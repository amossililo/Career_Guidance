    <h2> Geomatics Engineering</h2>

    <p>
        A program that prepares individuals to apply mathematical
        principles to the determination of the location, elevations,
        and alignment of natural and man-made topographic features.
        It includes instruction in property line location, surveying,
        surface measurement, aerial and terrestrial photogrammetry,
        remote sensing, satellite imagery, global positioning systems,
        computer applications, and photographic data processing.
        It involves the study of precise measurement for mapping the
        earthâ€™s environment using advanced equipment and techniques.
        Geomatics Engineers play an important role in planning future
        infrastructure and often work with large amounts of data to
        form digital replications of terrain and develop 3D maps. This
        also includes the study of GPS (Global, Positioning System)
        technology.
        There is a shortage of qualified Geomatics professionals and,
        as a result, they are in great demand.
        Studying Geomatics Engineering may find one working as a:
