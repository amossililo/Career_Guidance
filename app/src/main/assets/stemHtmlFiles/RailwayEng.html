    <h1>Railway engineering</h1>
    <p>
        Railway engineering is a multifaceted engineering discipline
        that deals with the design, construction, and operation of all
        railway transport systems. It encompasses a lot of engineering
        disciplines such as civil engineering, mechanical engineering,
        electrical engineering, computer engineering, industrial engineering and production engineering. It was introduced in 2017
        in Zambia and it is only offered at the Copper belt University
        in the school of engineering.
        Like all engineering programs except for computer engineering, railway engineering is a 5-year program.
