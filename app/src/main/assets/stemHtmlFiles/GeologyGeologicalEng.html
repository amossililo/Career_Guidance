    <h2> Geotechnical and Geo-Environmental
        Engineering</h2>
    <p>
        A program that prepares individuals to apply geotechnical
        engineering methods, which deal with the analysis, design
        and construction of earth and earth supported structures, to
        the application of environmental problems, such as waste
        containment, waste disposal, and construction of landfills, soil
        permeation, soil analysis, and soil improvement. It includes
        instruction in soil mechanics, soil dynamics, soil behaviour,
        waste management and containment systems, geosynthetics,
        geochemistry, earth structures, geo-environmental engineering, geotechnical engineering,
        earthquake engineering, and
        foundation engineering. Studying Geotechnical engineering
        may find one working as:
