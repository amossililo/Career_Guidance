    <h2>  Geology/Geological Engineering
    </h2>
    <p>
        Geology is the study of the Earth, including its physical structure,
        processes, and history. It is a broad and interdisciplinary field that
        involves the study of rocks, minerals, fossils, and landscapes, as well as
        the study of the natural resources that the Earth provides, such as oil,
        gas, and minerals.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are various program variations in geology that students can pursue to
        specialize in a particular area of the field. Some of the common program
        variations in geology include:
    </p>
    <p>
