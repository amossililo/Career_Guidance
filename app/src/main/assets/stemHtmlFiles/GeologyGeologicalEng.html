    <h2>  Geology/Geological Engineering
    </h2>
    <p>
        A program that prepares individuals to apply mathematical
        and geological principles to the analysis and evaluation of
        engineering problems, including the geological evaluation
        of construction sites, the analysis of geological forces acting
        on structures and systems, the analysis of potential natural
        resource recovery sites, and applied research on geological
        phenomena.
        Geology is the study of the structure, evolution and history
        of the earth and its mineral and energy resources. It analyzes
        the processes that have shaped the earth, using rocks and
        minerals to reconstruct that history. It studies the earthâ€™s
        processes such as landslides, earthquakes, floods and volcanoes
        and how hazardous they can be to people, it also studies
        earth materials such as oil, minerals, water and how all these
        materials are formed and how they can be traced or located.
        Geologists discover natural resources, protect water quality and
        the environment, mitigate natural hazards and explain how life
        and earth developed. Studying geology may find one working
        as a:
