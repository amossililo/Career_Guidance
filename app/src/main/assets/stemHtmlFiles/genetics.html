    <h1> Genetics</h1>

    <h3>The focus here in any field of study is genetics.</h3>

    <p><strong>i. Animal Genetics</strong></p>
    <!--your automatic html file goes here -->
    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of the genetics
        of multicellular animal life forms from the experimental, comparative, and clinical
        (veterinary and medical) viewpoints. It
        includes instruction in molecular genetics, gene expression,
        gene regulation, genomics, epigenetic phenomena, DNA recombination and repair, genetic
        interactions at the microbial
        and higher levels, and molecular evolution.</p>

    <p><strong>ii. Genetics General</strong></p>
    <p>A general program that focuses on the scientific study of
        the organization, recombination, function, regulation, and
        transmission of heritable information in biological organisms at
        all levels of complexity. It includes instruction in Mendelian genetics, mechanisms of gene
        regulation, chromosome structure
        and replication, epigenetic phenomena, DNA repair and recombination, sex determination,
        genetic interactions between
        genomes, and molecular evolution.</p>

    <p><strong>iii. Human/Medical Genetics</strong></p>


    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of human
        genetics from the standpoint of medical applications such
        as clinical diagnosis, genetic engineering and therapy, transplantation, and the study of
        genetic diseases and disabilities
        and their defense. Includes instruction in human molecular
        genetics; genetic factors causing disease; changes in gene
        expression during development, differentiation, and pathogenesis; recombinant DNA; gene
        therapy; clinical genetics; genetic
        epidemiology; immunogenetics; cytogenetics; and genetics of specific disorders and
        diseases.</p>

    <p><strong>iv. Plant Genetics</strong></p>


    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of the genetics of
        multicellular plants and fungi as related to botanical research
        and to apply in comparative genetics, ecology and evolutionary
        studies, clinical studies, and industrial research. It includes
        instruction in molecular genetics, gene expression, gene regulation, genomics, epigenetic
        phenomena, DNA recombination
        and repair, genetic interactions at the microbial and higher
        levels, and molecular evolution.
