<h1> Electrical and Electronics Engineering </h1>
    <p>
        Electrical and Electronics Engineering is an engineering discipline that deals with the generation, transmission and distribution of power in form of electrical, hydro and natural
        resources such as wind and solar energy to light our cities, our
        homes and our industries. It is concerned with the practical
        applications of electricity in all its forms, including those of
        the field of electronics. It specifically deals with the design
        and application of equipment, devices and systems which
        use electricity, electronics and electromagnetism. Electrical
        and Electronics Engineers design components for electronics
        equipment, communication systems, power grids, automobiles,
        buildings, industries and more.
