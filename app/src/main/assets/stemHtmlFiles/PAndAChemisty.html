    <h1> Pure And Applied Chemistry
    </h1>

    <p>A general program that focuses on the scientific study of the
        composition and behaviour of matter, including its micro
        and macrostructures, the processes of chemical change, and
        the theoretical description and laboratory simulation of these
        phenomena.
        Variations in chemistry include:</p>

    <p><strong>i. Analytical Chemistry</strong></p>
    <!--your automatic html file goes here -->
    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of techniques
        for analyzing and describing matter, including its precise
        composition and the interrelationships of constituent elements
        and compounds. It includes instruction in spectroscopy,
        chromatography, atomic absorption, photometry, chemical
        modelling, mathematical analysis, laboratory analysis procedures and equipment maintenance,
        and applications to specific
        research, industrial and health problems</p>

    <p><strong>ii. Environmental Chemistry
    </strong></p>
    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of natural systems
        (air, water, and soil) through the use of chemical techniques and
        instrumentation, with an emphasis on the movement and fate
        of pollutants and chemical aspects of contaminant remediation.
        It includes instruction in analytical, inorganic, organic, and
        physical chemistry; aquatic, soil, and atmospheric chemistry;
        environmental engineering; environmental toxicology; and
        analytical methods.</p>

    <p><strong>iii. Forensic Chemistry
    </strong></p>


    <p>A program that focuses on the application of chemical techniques and instrumentation to the
        analysis and evaluation of
        physical evidence to aid in criminal investigations. It includes
        instruction in analytical, inorganic, organic, and physical
        chemistry; biochemistry; forensic toxicology; instrumental
        analysis; crime scene processing; criminal investigation;
        forensic laboratory technology; and applicable law.</p>

    <p><strong>iv. Inorganic Chemistry</strong></p>


    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of the elements
        and their compounds, other than the hydrocarbons and their
        derivatives. It includes instruction in the characterization and
        synthesis of non-carbon molecules, including their structure
        and their bonding, conductivity, and reactive properties; research techniques such as
        spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and
        photoelectron analysis; and the study of specific compounds,
        such as transition metals, and compounds composed of inorganic and organic molecules.</p>


    <p><strong>v. Organic Chemistry
    </strong></p>


    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of the properties and
        behaviour of hydrocarbon compounds and their
        derivatives. It includes instruction in molecular conversion
        and synthesis, molecular synthesis and design, the molecular
        structure of living cells and systems, the mutual reactivity of
        organic and inorganic compounds in combination, the spectroscopic
        analysis of hydrocarbon compounds, and applications to specific problems in research,
        industry, and health</p>


    <p><strong>vi. Physical and Theoretical Chemistry</strong></p>


    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of understanding
        and predicting the behaviour of chemical systems ranging from
        nuclear particles to atoms, molecules, clusters, biological materials and macroscopic
        assemblies. It includes instruction in
        quantum mechanics, spectroscopy, thermodynamics, statistical
        mechanics, reaction dynamics, group theory, collision theory,
        and polymer science.
        Studying chemistry doesnâ€™t restrict you to a career in a
        laboratory; it can lead to many careers across a wide range
        of sector Job options.</p>
