    <h1> Biomathematics, Bioinformatics, and
        Computational Biology</h1>

    <h3>The following are sub-categories in .</h3>

    <p><strong>i. Bioinformatics</strong></p>
    <!--your automatic html file goes here -->
    <p>A program that focuses on the application of computer-based
        technologies and services to biological, biomedical, and biotechnology research. It includes instruction in algorithms, network
        architecture, principles of software design, human interface
        design, usability studies, search strategies, database management and data mining, digital image processing, computer
        graphics and animation, CAD, computer programming, and
        applications to experimental design and analysis and to specific
        quantitative, modelling, and analytical studies in the various
        biological specializations.</p>

    <p><strong>ii. Biometry/Biometrics</strong></p>
    <p>A program that focuses on the application of statistics and
        other computational methods to the study of problems in the
        biological sciences and related fields in agriculture and natural
        resources. It includes instruction in computational biology,
        mathematical statistics, matrix algebra, applied calculus, experimental design, linear modelling, sampling theory, stochastic
        processes, spatial and temporal analysis, longitudinal analysis,
        sparse/unbalanced data and complex error, and applications
        to such topics as population genetics, animal breeding, forest
        genetics, population dynamics, wildlife biometry, ecology, and
        agricultural and natural resource management.</p>

    <p><strong>iii. Biostatistics</strong></p>


    <p>A program that focuses on the application of descriptive and
        inferential statistics to biomedical research and clinical, public
        health, and industrial issues related to human populations.
        It includes instruction in mathematical statistics, modelling,
        clinical trials method, disease and survival analysis, longitudinal
        analysis, missing data analysis, spatial analysis, computer
        tomography, biostatistics consulting, and applications to such
        topics as genetics, oncology, pharmacokinetics, physiology,
        neurobiology, and biophysics.</p>

    <p><strong>iv. Computational Biology</strong></p>


    <p>A program that focuses on computational theoretical
        approaches to understanding biological systems, including
        computational models of biological processes, computational

        management of large-scale projects, database development
        and data-algorithm development, and high-performance
        computing, as well as statistical and mathematical analyzes.</p>
