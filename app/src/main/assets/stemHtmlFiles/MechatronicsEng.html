    <h1>Mechatronics Engineering
    </h1>
    <p>
        Mechatronics Engineering is a blend of mechanical engineering
        and electronics engineering for hybrid engineers. Nearly all mechanical equipment in this day and age is operated with a mix
        of electronics software, all based on computers and technology.
        It is a program that prepares individuals to apply mathematical principles to the design, development and operational evaluation of computer-controlled electro-mechanical systems and
        products with embedded electronics, sensors, and actuators;
        and which includes, but is not limited to, automata, robots
        and automation systems. It includes instruction in mechanical
        engineering, electronic and electrical engineering, computer
        and software engineering, and control engineering.
        Mechatronics Engineers help bridge the gap and have vast
        knowledge in electrical, electronics, and mechanical engineering. It is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering which
        combines mechanical, electrical and electronics, computer
        systems and control engineering.
        Mechatronics products include:
