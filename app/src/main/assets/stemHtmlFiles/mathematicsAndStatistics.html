    <h3>SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS PROGRAMS</h3>

    <p><strong>i. Applied Mathematics</strong></p>
    <!--your automatic html file goes here -->
    <p>A program that focuses on the application of mathematics and
        statistics to the solution of functional problems in fields such as
        engineering and the applied sciences. It includes instruction in
        natural phenomena modelling continuum mechanics, reactiondiffusion, wave propagation,
        dynamic systems, numerical
        analysis, controlled theory, asymptotic methods, variation,
        optimization theory, inverse problems, and applications to
        specific scientific and industrial topics.</p>

    <p><strong>ii. Computational and Applied Mathematics</strong></p>
    <p>A program that focuses on the application of a broad range of
        mathematical and computational methods to modelling, analysis, algorithm development, and
        simulation for the solution
        of complex scientific and engineering problems. It includes
        instruction in numerical analysis, discrete mathematics, operations research, optimization,
        differential equations, statistics,
        scientific computation, and applications to specific scientific
        and industrial topics.</p>

    <p><strong>iii. Computational Mathematics</strong></p>


    <p>A program that focuses on the application of mathematics to the
        theory, architecture, and design of computers, computational
        techniques, and algorithms. It includes instruction in computer
        theory, cybernetics, numerical analysis, algorithm development,
        binary structures, combinatory, advanced statistics, and related
        topics.</p>

    <p><strong>iv. Financial Mathematics</strong></p>


    <p>A program that focuses on the application of mathematics and
        statistics to the finance industry, including the development,
        critique, and use of various financial models. It includes
        instruction in probability theory, statistical analysis, numerical
        methods, computation and simulation methods, stochastic
        processes, economics, and financial markets and applications.</p>


    <p><strong>v. Operations Research</strong></p>


    <p>A program that focuses on the development and application of
        complex mathematical or simulation models to solve problems
        involving operational systems, where the system concerned
        is subject to human intervention. It includes instruction in
        advanced multivariate analysis, application of judgment and
        statistical tests, optimization theory and techniques, resource
        allocation theory, mathematical modelling, control theory, statistical analysis, and
        applications to specific research problems.
        .</p>

    <p><strong> vi. Mathematical Statistics and Probability</strong></p>


    <p>A program that focuses on the mathematical theory underlying
        statistical methods and their use. It includes instruction in
        probability theory parametric and non-parametric inference,
        sequential analysis, multivariate analysis, Bayesian analysis,
        experimental design, time series analysis, re-sampling, robust
        statistics, limit theory, infinite particle systems, stochastic
        processes, martingales, Markov processes, and Banach spaces.</p>

    <p><strong> vii. Mathematics and Statistics</strong></p>


    <p>A program with a general synthesis of mathematics and statistics or specialization that
        draws from mathematics and statistics. It includes instruction in calculus, linear algebra,
        numerical
        analysis and partial differential equations, discrete mathematics,
        probability theory, statistics, computing, and other related
        topics.
        The logical thinking, problem-solving and decision-making
        skills you learn while studying for a mathematics degree are
        highly valued by employers across many jobs sectors.
