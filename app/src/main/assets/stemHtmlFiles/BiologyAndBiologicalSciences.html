    <h1> Biology And Biological Sciences</h1>

    <h3>The focus here in any field of study is biology</h3>

    <p><strong>i. Molecular Biology</strong></p>
    <!--your automatic html file goes here -->
    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of the structure
        and function of biological macromolecules and the role of
        molecular constituents and mechanisms in supramolecular
        assemblies and cells. It includes instruction in such topics
        as molecular signalling and transduction, regulation of cell
        growth, enzyme substrates and mechanisms of enzyme action,
        DNA-protein interaction, and applications to fields such as
        biotechnology, genetics, cell biology, and physiology.</p>

    <p><strong>ii. Microbiology</strong></p>
    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of unicellular
        organisms and colonies, and subcellular genetic matter and
        their ecological interactions with human beings and other life.
        It includes instruction in microbial genetics, cell biology, cell
        physiology, virology, pathogenic microbiology, environmental
        microbiology, immunology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, and
        laboratory methods, including microscopy.</p>

    <p><strong>iii. Population biology</strong></p>


    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of the natural
        history, life cycle behaviour, and ecosystem dynamics of single species and multi-species
        communities, and the patterns
        and causes of diversity within and among such populations.
        Includes instruction in biostatistics, population dynamics,
        population and quantitative genetics, RNA and DNA sequences,
        genomics, evolutionary ecology, natural adaptation and hybridization,
        geographic differentiation, life history and life cycle studies, and animal and plant
        demography</p>

    <p><strong>iv. Botany/Plant Biology</strong></p>


    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of plants,
        related microbial organisms, and plant habitats and ecosystem
        relations. It includes instruction in plant anatomy and structure,
        phytochemistry, cytology, plant genetics, plant morphology
        and physiology, plant ecology, plant taxonomy and systematics,
        paleobotany, and applications of biophysics and molecular
        biology</p>


    <p><strong>v. Wildlife biology
    </strong></p>

    <p>A program that focuses on the application of biological principles to the study of
        vertebrate wildlife, wildlife habitats, and
        related ecosystems in remote and urban areas. It includes instruction in animal ecology;
        adaptational biology; urban ecosystems; natural and artificial habitat management;
        limnology;
        wildlife pathology; and vertebrate zoological specializations
        such as mammalogy, herpetology, ichthyology, ornithology, and
        others</p>

    <p><strong>vi. Zoology/Animal biology
    </strong>
    </p>

    <p>A general program that focuses on the scientific study of the
        biology of animal species and phyla, regarding their molecular
        and cellular systems, anatomy, physiology, and behaviour. It Includes instruction in
        molecular and cell biology, microbiology,
        anatomy and physiology, ecology and behaviour, evolutionary
        biology, and applications to specific species and phyla.</p>

    <p><strong>vii. Environmental biology
    </strong></p>

    <p>A program that focuses on the scientific study of the origins,
        functions, relationships, interactions, and natural history of
        living populations, communities, species, and ecosystems
        in relation to dynamic environmental processes. Includes
        instruction in biodiversity, molecular genetics and genomic
        evolution, mesoscale ecology, computational biology and modelling, conservation biology,
        local and global environmental
        change, and restoration ecology.</p>


    <p><strong>viii. Conservation Biology</strong></p>
    <p>A program that focuses on the application of the biological
        sciences to the specific problems of biodiversity, species preservation, ecological
        sustainability, and habitat fragmentation in
        the face of advancing human social, economic, and industrial
        pressures. It includes instruction in ecology, environmental science, biological systems,
        extinction theory, human-animal and
        human-plant interaction, ecosystem science and management,
        wetland conservation, field biology, forest and wildlife biology,
        and natural history.
    </p>

    <p><strong>ix. Human Nutrition</strong></p>
    <p>A program that focuses on the relationships between food
        consumption and human development and health. It includes
        instruction in the cellular and molecular processes of food
        processing in the human body, related metabolic processes, the
        relationship of food and nutrition to disease, and nutritional
        needs across the life span</p>

    <p><strong>x. Biotechnology</strong></p>
    <p>A program that focuses on the application of the biological sciences, biochemistry, and
        genetics to the preparation of new and
        enhanced agricultural, environmental, clinical, and industrial
        products, including the commercial exploitation of microbes,
        plants, and animals. Includes instruction in bioinformatics,
