    <h2>  Environmental Engineering

    </h2>
    <p>
        Environmental Engineering is the discipline that deals with
        the development of processes and infrastructure for the supply of water, disposal of waste and the control of pollution
        of all kinds, protecting public health by preventing disease
        transmission and preserving the quality of the environment
        by averting contamination and degradation of air, water and
        land resources. It involves the treatment and distribution of
        drinking water (water supply system, the collection, the treatment and disposal of wastewater (wastewater treatment) and
        municipal solid waste management. Environmental Engineers
        study the environmental impact humans have on the planet,
        including pollution because of development and manufacturing
        processes.
        It is a program that prepares individuals to apply scientific
        principles to the design, development and operational evaluation of systems for controlling contained living environments
        and for monitoring and controlling factors in the external
        natural environment, including pollution control, waste and hazardous material disposal, health and safety protection,
        conservation, life support, and requirements for the protection
        of special materials and related work environments.
