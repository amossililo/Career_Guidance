    <h1> Aeronautical Engineering </h1>
    <p>
        Aeronautical Engineering deals with the development of
        aircraft and spacecraft that includes military aircraft design and
        development, along with commercial airline design and satellite
        technology. It specifically deals with the design, analysis of
        aircraft structures, aircraft performances and their operations
        to transport goods, people and services around the globe.
        It is a program that prepares individuals to apply mathematical principles to the design,
        development and operational
        evaluation of aircraft, missiles, space vehicles, and their systems;
        applied research on flight and orbital characteristics; and the
        development of systems and procedures for the launching,
        guidance, and control of air and space vehicles.
