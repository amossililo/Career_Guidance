    <strong>Animal Genetics</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A program that focuses on the scientific study of the genetics of
    multicellular animal life forms from the experimental, comparative, and
    clinical (veterinary and medical) viewpoints. It includes instruction in
    molecular genetics, gene expression, gene regulation, genomics, epigenetic
    phenomena, DNA recombination and repair, genetic interactions at the
    microbial and higher levels, and molecular evolution.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Genetics, General</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A general program that focuses on the scientific study of the organization,
    recombination, function, regulation, and transmission of heritable
    information in biological organisms at all levels of complexity. It
    includes instruction in Mendelian genetics, mechanisms of gene regulation,
    chromosome structure and replication, epigenetic phenomena, DNA repair and
    recombination, sex determination, genetic interactions between genomes, and
    molecular evolution.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Human/Medical Genetics</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A program that focuses on the scientific study of human genetics from the
    standpoint of medical applications such as clinical diagnosis, genetic
    engineering and therapy, transplantation, and the study of genetic diseases
    and disabilities and their defense. Includes instruction in human molecular
    genetics; genetic factors causing disease; changes in gene expression
    during development, differentiation, and pathogenesis; recombinant DNA;
    gene therapy; clinical genetics; genetic epidemiology; immunogenetics;
    cytogenetics; and genetics of specific disorders and diseases.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Plant Genetics</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A program that focuses on the scientific study of the genetics of
    multicellular plants and fungi as related to botanical research as well as
    to applications in comparative genetics, ecology and evolutionary studies,
    clinical studies, and industrial research. It includes instruction in
    molecular genetics, gene expression, gene regulation, genomics, epigenetic
    phenomena, DNA recombination and repair, genetic interactions at the
    microbial and higher levels, and molecular evolution.
