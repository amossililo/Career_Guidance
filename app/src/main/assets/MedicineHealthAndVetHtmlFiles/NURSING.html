    Nursing combines compassion, knowledge and sophisticated health technology
    to restore, maintain and promote the health of individuals, groups, or
    communities. Nursing is both an art and a science: caring, compassionate
    relationships blended with the development and application of nursing
    knowledge, techniques and ethics.

    According to Collins medical dictionary, nursing is the branch of medicine
    that deals with the practice of caring for the sick and injured.
