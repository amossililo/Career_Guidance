<p>
    The Bachelor of Science in the field of Occupational Therapy degree aims to
    skill students in helping clients who are temporarily or permanently
    impaired by illness, accident, disability, environmental limitations or
    developmental delay.
</p>
<p>
    Occupational Therapy is the therapeutic use of self-care, work, education,
    play, leisure and social activities to increase independent function,
    enhance development, promote health and well-being and prevent disability.
    It is indicated when people lose their ability to carry out their everyday
    activities, due to temporary or permanent illness, disability,
    environmental limitations and developmental delay.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What do occupational therapists do</strong>
    ?
</p>
<p>
    Occupational therapists assess a person’s ability to engage in daily
    activities. They then engage the person in meaningful and culturally
    appropriate activities to maximise their functioning and wellbeing. This
    engagement empowers the person to be as independent as possible, and
    enhances dignity and quality of life at work, school, at home, and during
    leisure. Intervention may include adapting the person’s environment to help
    them to cope.
</p>
<p>
    Occupational Therapy is practised in a wide range of public, private, and
    voluntary settings, like the person’s home, schools, workplaces, health
    centres, supported accommodation, housing for seniors, rehabilitation
    centres, hospitals, and forensic services.
