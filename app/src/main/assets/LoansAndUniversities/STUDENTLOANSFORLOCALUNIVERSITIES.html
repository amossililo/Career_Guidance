<h3>
    REPAYING THE LOAN
</h3>
<p>
    The higher education loans and scholarship board aim is not just to recover
    all loans with interest, but to raise sufficient funds to meet the rising
    loan demand in Zambia among the vulnerable, privileges and less privileged
    to live their dream. The loan recoveries also help HELSB achieve the
    concept of revolving funds and this enhances the loan payments to students.
</p>
<h3>
    REPAYMENT METHOD
</h3>
<p>
    A beneficiary’s loan repayment starts within one year of completion of
    studies or within such a period as the board decides to recall the loan
    whichever is earlier. However, a beneficiary can make voluntary payments
    before or after their studies to reduce the loan balance.
</p>
<h3>
    Monthly Deduction Method (MDM)
</h3>
<p>
    A beneficiary is expected to pay back the loan in monthly installments at a
    compound interest rate of 15%.
</p>
<h3>
    Offset Method (OM)
</h3>
<p>
    A beneficiary is expected to pay back the loan in huge installments or
    clear the whole balance at a simple interest rate of 15% on each payment.
</p>
<h3>
    Terms of Recoveries.
</h3>
<p>
    After one year grace period elapses, a beneficiary is expected to visit
    HELSB offices for a repayment plan.
